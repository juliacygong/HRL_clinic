"""The two-qubit / EF suite's RTL half: what the SoC EMITS on the 3-core `sim-2q1c` build (2 qubits
+ 1 coupler) and the 2-core `sim-2q` one, and what that stimulus does to the qubits.

After the T6 migration (specs/software-test-refactor/02 §3.5) this file is split by tier:

- **L1** (01 §3) — the emitted stimulus, model OFF: the mid-shot GE↔EF retune, the coupler-form and
  drive-form CZ fires, the spectator bracket and the EF-sandwich train, all captured off the real
  DACs and asserted to the batch. Deterministic, and the only tier that can see `LEAD`/`SEP`.
- **L2** (01 §4) — what those circuits do to the qubits, read off `drv.sim.model_state()` through
  `tests.probe.Probe`: one shot per point, an ANALYTIC target, no fit and no shot statistics.
- **L0** — the EF `Phase` write-back, host-pure against the shared `responder`.

Everything the old counts-mode versions inferred through fits — the EF Rabi / Ramsey / crossing
analyses, the CZ 2D argmax and its `CZ/freq` + `CZ/pulse` write-back, the `joint_populations` zip
and the 3-level cluster statistics — is host-pure in `tests/test_twoqubit.py` (against the analytic
responder) and `tests/test_models.py` (models driven directly). The one `--slow` anchor,
`test_jazz_runs_end_to_end_no_spurious_zz`, puts the whole loop back together with real shots and
real noise, and is what notices if an L2 analytic target ever drifts from the hardware.

**Five tests here are over the 20 k per-test cap, and structurally cannot come under it.** Measured
on these builds, one core's `rq.setup` (image + envelopes + tables, all over AXI) costs **9.4–12.1 k
simulated batches** — the image words dominate, the envelopes barely register — while a `rerun` is
~1.8 k and a sized DAC capture ~2.3 k. So the floor for a claim that needs N core images is roughly
N × 10 k, and every multi-core claim needs one image per core by definition:

| test | cores | measured | floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| `test_spectator_ramsey_brackets_the_cz_fire` | 3 | 34.2 k | 3 images + capture |
| `test_cz_3core_drives_coupler_at_fcz_aligned` | 3 | 30.5 k | 3 images + capture |
| `test_cz_sandwich_dac_train_aligned` | 2 | 27.1 k | 2 images + capture |
| `test_cz_drive_form_two_tone_fire_aligned` | 2 | 25.7 k | 2 images + capture |
| `test_cross_core_shot_alignment` | 2 | 21.7 k | 2 images + 2 reruns |

Each is already at that floor: one point, one shot, the minimum legal relax head, and a capture sized
to boot + 2 grid periods. Nothing but the image count is left to cut, and cutting it would delete the
lock-step claim the test exists for. They are the per-file exemption 02 §1 anticipates ("tests that
legitimately need more land around 25–40 k; those are called out per-file rather than forced under
the cap"), and each carries an explicit `@pytest.mark.batch_cap` naming its floor. The whole file is
274 k batches / ~34 s, ~14 % of the 2 M suite budget.

    FLOOR: ~22 k = 2 core images (~10 k each over AXI) + 2 reruns. A cross-core claim needs one
    image per core by definition; the module docstring's table has the full accounting.

    Two production `_rawiq_prog` images (one per core) are loaded once and run together under the
    SAME `prep = 1`. The two models are planted with DIFFERENT rates — `rabi_for` π/2 per X90 on
    core 0, so its two-X90 prep is an exact π, and 0 on core 1 — so one stimulus must produce two
    DIFFERENT textbook states in one run. Both halves are asserted:

    - the STATE, off `model_state()["models"]`: core 0 at |1⟩, core 1 still at |0⟩, to 0.02. A
      crossed gate DAC, a core that never released, or a shared-time slip all break it.
    - the READOUT, through the real demod/decoder: the two tones ride distinct demod codes and SUM
      on the one converter, so recovering ⟨σz⟩ = −1 on core 0 and +1 on core 1 out of that sum is
      exactly the statement that each core's demod integrates out its OWN tone — i.e. that the two
      per-shot streams are genuinely separate lanes, which is what the joint two-qubit populations

    What this replaces: 32 projective shots per core on a 3200-batch relax grid, asserting
    P1 > 0.9 / < 0.1 and a dominant joint P(10). The zip itself (`joint_populations`, and that a
    shot-count mismatch is loud) is host-pure in test_twoqubit.py; the binomial statistics of the

    rotates {|1>, |2>}, by an angle exactly linear in the swept amplitude code.

    `k_ef_rabi`'s on-core Q16 sweep writes the code raw and the drive integral σ is linear in it, so
    a code k·A rotates by k·θ(A). Plant the rate that makes code A an exact EF X90 (`gate_sigma` at
    that code — the `probe.rabi_for` idiom) after a GE-π prep, and the rungs are the textbook
    quarter, half and full turns INSIDE the EF subspace, |0> untouched throughout:

        k = 1 -> (0, 1/2, 1/2)    k = 2 -> (0, 0, 1)  the EF pi, |1> -> |2>    k = 4 -> (0, 1, 0)  2pi

    which is the P(|2>) cosine the counts version fitted (recovered/planted to 15 %), read directly
    off `model_state()["populations"]` at three points to 0.02. |2> is invisible to the hardware
    `res` bit, so the state is the only exact readout of it; the fit and the `EF/x90/amp` proposal
    that turn this curve into a number are host-pure in test_twoqubit.py, which is also where the
    trained 3-level classifier the old version needed now lives.

    The base amplitude is 0.2 so the k = 4 rung (4 × 3979 = 15916) still fits under `units.AMP_SCALE`
    = 19896 — a hand-written "half scale" code would silently mis-scale every angle (01 §4.6). The GE

    """L2 (spec 01 §4.1 / Q1) — the RTL half of the EF Ramsey: an EF carrier detuned by δ really does
    RAMP THE EF DRIVE AXIS, so a pair of EF X90s separated by a wait accumulates exactly the phase δ
    says it should — inside {|1>, |2>}, after the GE π prep and the mid-shot retune.

    The model takes each drive's axis by demodulating the gate DAC against `f_ef`, so a carrier δ
    codes away ramps that axis by 2π·δ/2^12 rad per batch (16 DAC samples of δ/2^16 turns each). Two
    EF X90s whose axes differ by φ leave the pseudo-qubit at, exactly (Rodrigues, both axes in the
    pseudo-equator, starting from the |1> pole),

        <sz> = P(|1>) - P(|2>) = -cos(phi)   =>   P(|1>) = (1 - cos phi)/2,  P(|2>) = (1 + cos phi)/2

    with φ = 2π·δ·Δt/2^12 and Δt the two EF pulses' start-to-start separation (`k_ef_ramsey` places
    them `wait + ef` apart). φ = 0 is the aligned pair, i.e. a full EF π. Three waits pin the RATE —
    no fit, no fringe envelope, no 4 × 11 × 36-shot sweep through a 3-level classifier.

    The EF X90 is ONE batch long on purpose. The model applies one rotation per batch about that
    batch's axis, so a single-batch pulse is exactly a fixed-axis rotation and the two-axis formula
    above is exact; the default 4-batch gate would ramp its own axis mid-pulse (the detuned Rabi
    tilt), which no fixed-axis target can describe. The GE prep stays 4 batches — its carrier is
    resonant, so it has no ramp.

    What the populations CANNOT see is the ramp's SIGN: reflecting through the pseudo-xz-plane maps
    φ → −φ and leaves every population of a sequence starting at a pole invariant. So ±60 pins the
    rate for a carrier above AND below f_ef, while the sign lock-step the class turns it into (the
    V-fit vertex at applied = −δ, and the `EF/freq` proposal moving toward the true carrier) is
    arithmetic — the GE Frequency code, gated host-pure in test_cal_host.py.

    Tolerance 0.025, not 0.02: the model's per-batch demod recovers the drive axis from 16 samples,
    so the counter-rotating term at f_drive + f_ef leaves ~0.015 rad of axis residual per pulse
    (measured worst case here: 0.007 in population). That is deterministic, not statistical, and it
    is exactly the bound test_cal::test_frequency_recovers_detuning carries — 0.05 on <sz>, which is
    0.025 on a population."""

def test_cz_amp_freq_sweep_peaks_at_the_planted_cz(cosim):
    """L2 (spec 14 F4) — the physics the `CZAmpFreqSweep` landscape is MADE of, on the joint state:
    the drive-form CZ tone rotates the {|11>, |02>} pseudo-qubit by an angle linear in the swept
    amplitude, and a detuned carrier starves that rotation by exactly the off-resonant Rabi law.

    Both axes are the class's own — the amp is the HOST knob (`rq.write_slot('amp')` on the cz slot
    of the ONE resident image, no recompile) and the frequency is the ON-CORE `k_cz_pop` FREQ sweep
    word — so three cells of the landscape are walked exactly as the class walks it:

        amp = A*/2, on resonance   theta = pi   ->  P(|02>) = 1   the activation, full transfer
        amp = A*,   on resonance   theta = 2pi  ->  P(|11>) = 1   the round trip that IS the CZ
        amp = A*/2, detuned        the chevron arm: P(|02>) = (W^2/Wg^2)*sin^2(Wg*n/2)

    with W = theta/n the per-batch on-resonance rate, D = 2*pi*dcode/2^12 the per-batch axis ramp and
    Wg = hypot(W, D). A tone of AF_CZ_BATCHES = 32 batches detuned by 128 codes ramps its axis by
    exactly one full turn, putting that cell at 0.026 — a 38x starvation, and the analytic value to
    four decimals (the model steps the ramping axis batch by batch, which is the continuum law's own
    discretization; the Trotter residue at these knobs is 1e-4).

    Two deliberate reductions, both forced by the 20 k budget (02 §1) and both with an owner
    elsewhere:

    - only the CONTROL core is loaded, and the TARGET is planted in |1> (`init = [0, 1]`) instead of
      playing its own prep — a second `k_cz_pop` image costs another ~10 k simulated batches, which
      alone would blow the cap. So the CZ runs on ONE line and `rabi_cz` is planted for |E| = A
      rather than 2A. That the two lines fire in LOCK-STEP at the same carrier with the calibrated
      relative phase is L1, in test_cz_drive_form_two_tone_fire_aligned above; that they combine as
      the COHERENT SUM E = A_c*exp(i*phi_c) + A_t*exp(i*phi_t) is host-pure in
      test_models::test_twoqubit_drive_form_rate_is_the_coherent_two_line_sum; that a GE prep really
      reaches |1> is L2 in test_cal::test_prep_gate_x90_and_x_agree.
    - the metric is the {|11>, |02>} POPULATION, not the conditionality R. R needs four tomography
      reruns per cell (36 for a 3x3 grid, ~90 k batches) and it measures the conditional PHASE, which
      no population can see. The 2D argmax, the `R > 0.5` acceptance and the `CZ/freq` + `CZ/pulse`
      write-back are gated host-pure against this same ramping-axis physics in
