"""B1(b) experiment (spec 08 §2.2): can the demod carrier be re-tuned + re-played ON-CORE?

The folklore (`riscq/cal/readout.py`: "the demod carrier can't be re-tuned + re-played on-core") had
no recorded root cause and forced the VNA (Separation) into a host loop. This runs the deciding
experiment: one program that `set_freq(demod, code)` + re-plays per point on a fixed grid (each retune
scheduled `period` ≫ LEAD ahead of its play, so the phasor-regen lead is covered — map.py LEAD note),
against a fixed ADC tone. The on-core sweep must resolve the matched code the same as the host-loop VNA
(a peak at 4×the DAC code, per test_readout); then the demod retunes on-core and the VNA can batch in
iqsum mode.

Verdict: PASSES — the retune+replay works on-core with adequate lead (no folklore limitation), so the
VNA batches on-core (spec §2.2 / §6). The old claim was insufficient-lead folklore, not a HW limit."""
