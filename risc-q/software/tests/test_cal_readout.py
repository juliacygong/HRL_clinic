"""The readout-completeness pieces of spec 14 F2: the confusion correction (`rcorr`, qcal's
`rcorr_cmat`), the 3-level `ReadoutFidelity`'s guards, and — in co-sim — that the three real preps
actually reach levels 0/1/2.

`rcorr` is the one piece of readout analysis with an exact answer — push a known population vector
through a known confusion matrix and the correction has to return it bit-for-bit (up to float error),
so these are equalities, not tolerances. That is the whole 3×3 confusion ARITHMETIC, host-pure, and
it is why the co-sim half no longer measures a matrix (specs/software-test-refactor/02 §3.6): the
old gate spent `relax = 8000` × 32 shots × 3 preps — the second-worst test in the suite — to
rediscover, through shot noise, that a diagonal-dominant matrix inverts.

What is left for the simulator is the one claim the host cannot make: that the three PRODUCTION
prep programs — idle, the GE π, and `_ef_prep_prog`'s GE π + EF π — really drive the qutrit to
levels 0, 1 and 2. That is an **L2 state probe** (01 §4): |2⟩ is invisible to the hardware `res`
bit (one threshold, two outcomes), so it is read off `drv.sim.model_state()["populations"]`, one
noiseless shot per prep against the analytic target.
