"""Host tests for the DRAG calibration (spec 14 F3): the FAST_DRAG spectral optimizer.

The optimizer is host-only arithmetic — an envelope, an FFT and an argmin — so it is checked against
a REIMPLEMENTATION of qcal's own loop (optimization/pulse.py:19-110) on the same envelope: same
padding, same axis convention, same coordinate-descent order. If the two ever disagree, one of them
has drifted from the paper's FAST DRAG.
