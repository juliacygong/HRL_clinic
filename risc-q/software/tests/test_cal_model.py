"""M4a model-physics sanity (cosim): prove the extended TwoLevelModel BEFORE the M4b
calibrations build on it.

- Ramsey (X90, wait, X90, measure) on a DETUNED model: the integrated readout oscillates vs the
  wait at the planted detuning. The extended model takes the drive AXIS from the gate DAC
  demodulated against f_ge, so a carrier off f_ge ramps the axis at (f_drive − f_ge) and the fringe
  falls out with no explicit free-precession term — <σz> = −exp(−t/T2)·cos(2π·f·τ) with
  f = δ_code/4096 cycles per wait-batch (δ_code = f_drive − f_ge in SF16). Recovered with
  fits.fit_damped_cosine.
- T1 (prepare |1> with a π pulse, wait, measure): <σz> recovers toward ground as 1 − 2·exp(−Δt/T1),
  recovered with fits.fit_exp_decay. To keep the demod phase and the decay-clock reference constant
  across the sweep, the readout time is FIXED and the π pulse is placed `delay` batches before it
  (a longer delay = an earlier pulse), so the elapsed decay is exactly `delay`.

Both sweeps are L2 state probes (specs/software-test-refactor/01 §4): `tests.probe.Probe` loads the
program ONCE and re-runs it per point. Each point re-prepares the qubit from |0> because set_model
rebuilds the model — the model is one evolving Bloch vector, so it MUST be reset between points —
and that rebuild costs zero simulated cycles. The demod pipeline phase is calibrated once (a
ReadoutCalibration in miniature, like M3) so the integrated real carries the signed <σz>. Every
model is selected over Pyro5; the fixture is session-scoped.
