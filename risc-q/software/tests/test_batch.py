"""B2 acceptance (spec 08 §9): the batched kernels — one run returns a whole sweep. Each scenario
drives a batched kernel DIRECTLY (the cal-class rewiring is B5), so this file is where the four
kernels' own circuits and the batched run layer are pinned, split by tier
(specs/software-test-refactor/01, migration 02 §3.3):

- **L1** (01 §3) — what the SoC EMITS, model off or on a deterministic `ToneModel`: the matched-pair
  IQSUM VNA and its grid invariance, the computed amp sweep bit-exact on the gate DAC, the demod
  table's phase and window knobs through the real `write_slot` + rerun path, and the RAW per-shot
  cursor (row 0 is not an outlier; the two preps land antipodal).
- **L2** (01 §4) — what those circuits do to the QUBIT, read off `drv.sim.model_state()` /the real
  soft readout through `tests.probe.Probe`: one shot per point, an ANALYTIC target, no fit and no
  shot statistics. These four replace `test_counts_{rabi,frequency,t1,t2}`, which re-measured
  `test_cal.py`'s physics at the kernel level through 21×160 / 15×48 / 9×120 projective sweeps.

The fits those counts sweeps ran, and the statistics that made them meaningful, are host-pure:
`riscq.cal.fits` in `test_cal_fits.py`, the cluster/binomial properties in `test_models.py`, and the
whole fit→propose→apply loop in `test_cal_host.py` against the analytic responder.
