"""B1 acceptance (spec 08 §2.4 / §9): the projective TwoLevelModel (collapse=True) drives the REAL
readout datapath — readout drive → demod carrier → carrier-triggered decoder → res/real/imag — to a
DEFINITE state per shot. An X90 prepares a bz = 0 superposition every shot, so the shots split into
two antipodal IQ clusters and the hardware `res` bit is the sign of the integrated real.

**L1 smoke** (specs/software-test-refactor/01 §3, migration 02 §3.6). The 150-shot binomial half of
this test is gone: `p̂ ≈ 1/2 within the binomial CI` is a STATISTICS claim, and statistics belong at
L0 where the model can be driven a million times for free —
`test_models.py::test_twolevel_projective_binomial_statistics` already owns it at n = 6000 (this
file could only afford 150), and its premise — that the collapse leaves a pure pole which the next
X90 maps back to the equator, so every shot re-prepares p = 1/2 with no reset — is
`test_models.py::test_twolevel_projective_reprepares_from_either_pole`. What is genuinely
additional here, and lives nowhere else, is the DATAPATH: that a collapsed shot arrives at the
decoder as a full-scale definite-state phasor rather than the ⟨σz⟩ ≈ 0 smear a soft model would
emit, that the shots really are bimodal through the real integrator, and that `res` is the sign of
the integrated real. Twelve shots pin all three.

The demod-phase calibration is gone with them. It cost two full `rq.run`s of a probe kernel (~17 k
simulated batches, more than the measurement) and bought only the |0>→+real orientation; every
claim below is stated relative to the shots themselves, so the arbitrary pipeline phase drops out
and the test is strictly more robust. The orientation claim — that a CALIBRATED demod phase lands
|0> on +real and |1> on −real — is owned by `test_batch.py::test_applied_demod_phase`, which
applies that phase through the real `write_slot` path.

The soft model (default) is exercised unchanged by the whole existing suite (test_readout/test_cal).
