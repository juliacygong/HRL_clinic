"""L2 state probes (specs/software-test-refactor/01 §4).

The question an L2 test asks is *did the signal the SoC just played put the qubit where the gate
intends?* The RTL runs for real; the answer is then **read**, not re-measured with shot statistics.

Two ways to read it, both exact:

- `Probe.state()` — `drv.sim.model_state()`, the model's own ground truth. Sees everything:
  Bloch phase, |2⟩ leakage, joint two-qubit populations. Does not exercise the readout chain.
- `Probe.sigma_z()` — through the **real** demod/decoder. In soft (`collapse=False`) mode the
  emitted tone amplitude is `readout_amp · ⟨σz⟩`, a continuous signed function of the state, so
  with `noise_scale=0` **one shot is a complete measurement** — there is nothing for repetition to
  average away. Prefer this when the readout path is part of what the test is pinning. Measured
  agreement with the model's own Bloch z: 4 decimal places.

Resetting the qubit costs nothing: re-issuing `set_model` rebuilds the model, so the state returns
to |0⟩ in **zero** simulated cycles. That is what removes the ~1600-batch T1-relax head that
dominates the old tests.

**Load once, rerun per point.** Measured on sim-2q: `rq.setup` (the image load, word-by-word over
AXI) costs ~6 640 simulated batches, a `rerun` ~1 980, `set_model` ~400. So a resident program
probes a point for ~2 200 batches where a fresh `rq.run` costs ~8 400 — a 5-point ladder is ~17 k
instead of ~84 k, i.e. the difference between fitting the 20 k budget and not.

The rule (01 §4.4): assert against an **analytic** target — what the gate is supposed to do — never
against another run of the same model.

    p = Probe(cosim, {0: prog})
    spec = dict(kind="twolevel", core=0, f_ge=F_GE, readout_code=RO_CODE,
                rabi_rad_per_amp=rabi_for(m, x90, F_GE, math.pi / 2))   # an exact X90
    b = p.state(spec, {0: {"n": 1}})["bloch"]        # params are PER CORE, like rq.rerun's
    assert b[2] == pytest.approx(0.0, abs=0.02)      # on the equator
    assert b[1] == pytest.approx(-1.0, abs=0.02)     # ...on −y: the axis is pinned too

`params` is keyed by core and forwarded verbatim to `rq.rerun`, which does `params.get(core, {})`.
A bare `{"n": 1}` is therefore not an error — it silently writes NO params and the run uses the
compile-time defaults. Always key by core.
