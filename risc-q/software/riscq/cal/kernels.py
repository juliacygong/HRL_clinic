"""Batched calibration kernels (spec 08 §2.1, spec 09 §4): one run returns a WHOLE sweep. Each
calibration family has one ~20-line kernel that walks the sweep on a fixed-period grid — the sweep is
a loop on the core, not a host loop of short runs (the design of record, README principle 3 / spec 06
§2).

Every swept knob is an affine sequence (`x_i = x0 + i·dx`), so the kernel COMPUTES it on-core instead
of walking a host-preloaded input Array (spec 09): code knobs (amp/freq codes) accumulate a Q16 pair
`(x0q, dxq)` written to the register RAW — the integer code sits in `data[31:16]`, the low fraction
is ignored by hardware (spec 12), so there is no `>> 16` extraction; time/phase knobs accumulate a
plain int pair (phase pre-seated by the host). `out` is the only Array left. The knob advance sits at the END of the point: rows realize `[x0, x0+dx, x0+2dx, ...]`. There is
no warm-up row — the cold-first-read guard it once absorbed was root-caused and retired (spec 11).

Every shot fires on a fixed `period` grid whose idle head is the T1 relax reset (the model has no
auto-reset, spec-M4 B0), so all readouts land at the same time-referenced demod-LO phase — no
straddled-reset dependence (spec 08 §2.2). A compile-time `mode` binding folds the shot tail (spec 08
§2.1 modes table): COUNTS accumulates the hardware-classified bit per point (exact, self-normalised
populations — no |0> reference needed); RAW writes per-shot IQ through a cursor (classifier work / the
poor-separation fallback); IQSUM (k_vna only) sums per-point IQ integrals coherently (the matched-pair
VNA). k_vna folds RAW too — the same frequency sweep with a |1> prep, so two reruns give both prep
states' clusters at every point (Separation's two-state SNR, spec 13 §5).
Every measurement plays the channel-1 readout drive (ro["meas"]) covering the demod window — mandatory
on hardware and the projective co-sim model's window trigger; firing the demod IS the readout (its
`dur` is the integration window). The demod opens `ddly` batches after the drive (a compile-time
binding: the config's ADC round-trip delay, spec 13 §3 — 0 in co-sim). read_res() is called first every
shot (it HALTS until the integral settles) so read_real/read_imag latch THIS shot; the demod carrier is
issued LAST so the run-invariant demod, not the variable drive, is the trailing posted store (spec 08 §2.2).

`prep` is a scalar per-run param (spec 09 §1): the readout cals that need both prep states run the same
resident program twice (prep=0 / prep=1) through the setup/rerun layer. The virtual-Z in k_ramsey and
k_phase is a channel phaseOffset (spec 09 B1), NOT a pulse-table `phase` rewrite, so the calibrated x90
table phase survives the run.

DEEP GATE TRAINS (spec 14 F1). An n-gate train walks a FIXED `step`-batch grid (host-computed,
base.train_step) and is PACED: gate g is pushed only after gate g − TRAIN_AHEAD has started, so the
depth-4 param queues never overflow (an unpaced train silently drops everything past the 4th gate).
Each gate is placed explicitly at its own `t` rather than riding B0's startTime auto-advance, because
`step` exceeds the pulse length whenever the pulse is too short for the core to keep up (base's
TRAIN_STEP); when it does not, `step` IS the length and the train is back-to-back as before.

THE X90 FRAME BRACKET (spec 13 §7). qcal's X90 is virtualz(vz0) . FAST_DRAG . virtualz(vz1): part of
its frame correction lands before the pulse and part after, so the pulse's axis sits BETWEEN the two
advances. EVERY X90 play in EVERY kernel is exactly that — `set_phase_offset(f + vz0); play/fire;
f += vz0 + vz1` with `f` an on-core frame rebuilt each shot — so the pair Phase calibrates
(`qubit/{q}/x90/vz`) is actually played by the other cals too, not only by k_phase. The kernels bind
the pair as two compile-time seated phase words: `vz0` and `vzsum` = vz0 + vz1 (base.x90_vz; the
seated domain of spec 12, wrapping mod 2^32 = mod one turn). A config with no pair (every co-sim one)
binds 0/0 and the bracket is a no-op. The config's X pulse carries no pair, so its branches play bare.

    point, `shots` shots on the fixed `period` grid; `out[0]` is the |1> count.

    The circuit repeats qcal's echo block `depth` times and then plays `tail` more X90s:

        block  =  Z90 · X90 · X90 · Z90 · Z90 · X90 · X90 · Z90

    Every Z90 is a VIRTUAL Z — a frame advance of π/2 (`hpi`, a seated phase word), no pulse — so a
    block costs four X90 plays. The two X90 pairs are played a full π apart in the frame, which
    echoes the rotation ANGLE away (an amplitude error cancels) while the tilt of the rotation axis
    out of the drive plane ACCUMULATES. That is what makes the sequence read the X90's drive phase
    relative to its virtual-Z frame rather than its amplitude — the knob `qubit/{q}/x90/vz` sets.
    The block's frame advances sum to a full turn, so it leaves the frame where it found it.

    It is emitted as 2·depth halves of `Z90 · X90 · X90 · Z90`: the block IS two of those, and the
    Z90 · Z90 in its middle is just where two halves meet.

    `tail` reads the two BALANCED quadratures. Two trailing X90s are an X180, which maps the Bloch
    vector (x, y, z) → (x, −y, −z) and so reads exactly the opposite z-basis outcome: tail 0/2 are
    the cos pair, tail 1/3 the sin pair. Reading both closes is what keeps a fringe not centred on
    ½ (T1 decay before the readout) out of the angle — the same four-close trick RPEAmplitude plays
    on the direct train.

    `depth`/`tail`/`step` are compile-time bindings but the block loop is a RUNTIME `for`, so depth
    costs wall time, not instruction memory. The 4·depth + tail plays walk the paced `step` grid of
    the module docstring (spec 14 F1) — every play, including the first, is pushed only once the
    play TRAIN_AHEAD before it has started. `herald` folds exactly as in k_rabi."""

    compile-time `seq` binding folds to one of qcal's circuits (single_qubit.py:862-963):

      Y180_X90:  Rz(+pi/2) X90 X90 Rz(-pi/2) X90   (the first two X90s make a Y180)
      X180_Y90:  X90 X90 Rz(+pi/2) X90            (the first two make an X180, the last a Y90)
      X90_X_X90: X90 X X90                        (qcal's gate='X' circuit)

    An `Rz` is a channel FRAME advance (`set_phase_offset`, the virtual-Z of spec 09 B1); `hpi` is
    pi/2 as a seated phase word. X180_Y90's trailing Rz(-pi/2) is qcal's frame bookkeeping AFTER the
    last pulse — unobservable in a z-basis measurement, and the frame is rebuilt every shot — so it is
    not emitted.

    X90_X_X90 sweeps a DIFFERENT knob from the two X90 circuits: the two X90s carry the config's own
    calibrated frame bracket (vz0/vzsum), and the swept phi tilts only the X's AXIS — the X pulse's
    own `phase`, which is what qcal's `Phase(gate='X')` writes (its param is the X pulse entry's
    kwargs/phase). X90 · X(axis phi) · X90 is a 2pi rotation that returns to |0> only when the X sits
    on the X90s' axis, so P(1) is cosinusoidal in phi with its MINIMUM at the calibrated value.

    THE FRAME CONTRACT. qcal's X90 is virtualz(vz0) . FAST_DRAG . virtualz(vz1): part of the frame
    correction lands before the pulse and part after, so the pulse's axis sits BETWEEN the two
    advances. Every X90 play here is exactly that — `set_phase_offset(f + vz0); play; f += vz0 + vz1`
    with `f` an on-core frame — and the swept knob IS the virtual-Z: qcal sweeps one phase and writes
    it to BOTH slots (single_qubit.py:1081), so vz0 = vz1 = phi here. phi is computed on-core from the
    host-seated pair (p0/dp, spec 12) and the pulse table's own axis `phase` (the FAST_DRAG's, which
    this calibration does NOT touch) rides underneath it in the slot.

    `herald` is a COMPILE-TIME binding (spec 13 §8): 0 → today's shot tail, byte-identical; 1 → a
    pre-sequence herald read at `t_ro − hoff` gates the shot on the qubit being in |0>, and `out`

# ── EF-subspace kernels (spec two-qubit/01 §4.1) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The EF calibrations drive the {|1>, |2>} transition on the SAME gate channel as GE, ONE carrier at a
# time: a GE pi first populates |1>, then the carrier is retuned to f_ef for the EF drive. Both switch
# the carrier TWICE per shot — set_freq(ge) tagged at the GE-prep start, set_freq(ef) at the EF-drive
# start (each set_freq is queued against the buffer's CURRENT startTime, so the explicit set_start that
# precedes it pins the retune's effective time; SOC_TIPS §5). A full LEAD gap separates the GE-prep end
# from the EF drive so the ef phasor regen (leadFreqP = linkPipe+52 < LEAD) never overruns the tail of
# the GE pulse. Both are RAW-only: |1> vs |2> discrimination is host-side (the 3-level ClassifierN reads
# P(|2>) off the clusters), the hardware res sign cannot separate them. `ge_freq`/`ef_freq` are SEATED
# carrier words (units.freq_to_code); the GE prep is a two-X90 pi carrying its frame bracket (vz0/vzsum,
# the module docstring), and the EF gate carries its OWN bracket (evz0/evzsum, base.ef_vz) on the EF
# frame the retune starts at 0 — qcal's EF X90 is the same virtualz . FAST_DRAG . virtualz triplet, and
# EFPhase calibrates that pair into qubit/{q}/EF/x90/vz (spec 14 §3 finding 6). The EF X carries no pair.

# ── JAZZ: residual-ZZ Ramsey (spec two-qubit/01 §4.3) ───────────────────────────────────────────
# The first two-qubit measurement: X90s + idles only, no coupler/EF drive. Each core of the pair runs
# ONE role of the SAME kernel on the SAME fixed grid (the shared batch clock is the only sync, as in
# every multi-core cal). The TARGET does a Hahn-echo Ramsey — X90 · idle w · [pi on both] · idle w ·
# Rz(phi) · close X90/Y90 — while the CONTROL preps |0>/|1> and echoes in lock-step. A pi on BOTH
# qubits at the midpoint (BIRD) refocuses each qubit's own detuning but preserves the control-
# conditional ZZ, so the target fringe frequency shifts by the ZZ between the control states; the host
# fits f(control=1) − f(control=0) = ZZ (zz.py:43-288). The four sequences per delay (C0/C1 × X90/Y90
# close) are RUNTIME reruns of one resident image: `prep` (control |0>/|1>) and `quad` (X90/Y90 close)
# are scalars, so nothing recompiles between them.

# ── CZ calibration (spec two-qubit/01 §4.4-4.5; two-qubit-drive form per spec 04 §4.1) ──────────
# Two gate forms share the three kernels through a compile-time `form` fold:
#
# COUPLER_FORM — the CZ is PARAMETRIC: a coupler-flux tone at f_CZ = |f_11 − f_02| Rabi-flops
# |11>↔|02>, and a full 2π round trip leaves |11> with the conditional π phase that IS the gate (the
# model's coupling, spec 01 §6). THREE compile-time roles on the shared grid: the two qubit cores
# (CONTROL/TARGET) prep + read out through their own demod/ADC lanes (frequency-multiplexed on the
# shared readout DAC), and the COUPLER core plays the CZ drive and NEVER fires its readout (spec 01
# §1) — it only walks the grid in lock-step. The COUPLER carries the swept knob; the qubit cores bind
# a dead 0 sweep. All timing math uses `xd` (the X90 dur, passed in) so the coupler role — whose gate
# table has only a "cz" slot, no "x90" — computes the same grid without referencing a missing slot.
#
# DRIVE_FORM — the fixed-frequency two-qubit-drive CZ (X6Y3, spec 04 §1): NO coupler core; both qubit
# cores play the CZ tone on their OWN gate channel at the common in-band `CZ/freq`, simultaneously
# (control line phase 0, target line the calibrated RELATIVE phase — baked in each core's "cz" slot).
# The tone shares the qubit's single gate NCO, so each core retunes f_GE -> f_CZ before the CZ
# segment and back after — the k_ef_* mechanism: `set_start(t)` pins each retune's effective time, a
# full LEAD gap separates a retuned play from the segment before it (phasor regen, leadFreqP <
# LEAD), and the segment timings are FIXED on the grid so the retune's deterministic frame slip
# (Δf · segment) is constant — it lands in the LocalPhases virtual-Z by design (spec 04 §1). The
# swept knob binds on BOTH cores in LOCKSTEP (same x0/dx pair): a FREQ sweep is the CZ-segment
# retune word itself, DUR/AMP are `set_dur`/`set_amp` on both cores' cz slot; `fcz` is the config
# f_CZ (seated word) the non-FREQ sweeps retune to.
#
# EF SANDWICH (spec 04 §1 / X4, the (5,6)/(6,7) X6Y3 pairs): the pair's CZ acts in the SHELVED
# manifold — string-reference pre/post-pulses play one member's EF X around the tones, |1>→|2>
# before and |2>→|1> after. Three more compile-time bindings on the drive-form kernels: `sw`=1 on
# the SHELF core folds in the two EF X segments (retune f_GE → f_EF → play "ef" → retune f_CZ →
# tone → retune f_EF → play "ef" → retune f_GE, every retuned play a full LEAD after the previous
# segment); `fef` is the shelf's seated EF carrier; `tail` = LEAD + the EF X length is the extra
# segment between the tone(s) and the close/readout region, bound on BOTH cores (0 on plain pairs)
# so the two lines still fire at the SAME absolute slot — the partner core just idles through the
# shelf's EF segments. All segments stay fixed on the grid, so the extra retunes' frame slips are
# constant and land in the LocalPhases virtual-Z like the plain form's (spec 04 §1).
#
# QUEUE-DEPTH PACING (X4 finding): every PulseGenerator parameter sits behind a depth-4 TimedQueue
# on the POSTED RF link — a push while the FIFO is full is silently DROPPED (no backpressure
# reaches the core). The deployed RegHead impl adds one head-stage slot (5 in flight happens to
# fit), but the Shadow/Srl* congestion variants have no head stage, so the portable contract is
# ≤ 4 scheduled-ahead entries per param queue. The shelf core's shot is 5 pulses (2 prep X90 +
# EF X + cz + EF X), so each sandwich fold issues its un-shelving block only after a `wait_until`
# that drains the cz train — by then the earlier entries have popped (a pulse pops `lead` BEFORE
# its start) and the queues never hold more than 4. The `ngates` CZ trains are paced the same way
# (base.TRAIN_AHEAD, spec 14 F1), which retires the old ngates ≤ 4−prep cap (spec 04 §5).

    play the swept CZ pulse, read out — so the CONTROL's |1> population DIPS as |11>→|02> (control
    1→0) and RETURNS as the round trip closes. A compile-time `knob` folds the CZ-pulse field the
    on-core pair (x0/dx) advances per point:

      FREQ — `set_freq(gate, xk)` the carrier (Q16 raw, realized code xk>>16): P(11) dips at f_CZ;
      DUR  — `set_dur(gate, cz, xk)` the slot's dur field (plain batches): truncates the fixed
             max-length (`czmax`) envelope's flat top → max P(11) return at a full round trip;
      AMP  — `set_amp(gate, cz, xk)` (Q16 raw): max P(11) return at a full 2π.

    COUPLER_FORM: the COUPLER role carries the sweep, the qubit roles bind a dead 0 pair. The coupler
    pulse is placed at the FIXED `t_ro − SEP − czmax` (the max sweep length), so the qubit prep timing
    is constant across a DUR sweep — a shorter dur just leaves an idle tail before readout.

    DRIVE_FORM (spec 04 §4.1): NO coupler role — this qubit core preps its own |1> (the |11> half),
    retunes f_GE → f_CZ (`set_start` + `set_freq`, a LEAD gap after the prep for the phasor regen),
    fires its OWN cz line at the fixed `t_ro − SEP − tail − czmax`, and reads out; the FREQ sweep IS
    the CZ-segment retune word, DUR/AMP hit this core's cz slot — the same pair bound LOCKSTEP on
    both cores. The cz plays in a fresh 0 frame: the slot phase carries the line's (relative) phase.
    `sw`=1 (the EF-sandwich shelf core, the module comment) folds the shelving EF X in after the
    prep and the un-shelving one at `t_ro − SEP − ef` (`tail` = LEAD + ef on both cores; 0 plain).

    or an X90 (`quad`=1, the Y-quadrature). A conditional-π CZ rotates the target's Bloch vector by π
    ONLY when the control is |1>, so the host's R = √((ΔP0_X)² + (ΔP0_Y)²) between the two control
    states → 1 at a perfect CZ (spec 01 §4.5). `prep`/`quad` are runtime scalars → the FOUR sequences
    are reruns of one resident image (as k_jazz). `quad` 2/3 close at −Y90/−X90 — each the π-opposite
    of its 0/1 partner, so a (0, 2) or (3, 1) rerun pair reads BALANCED quadratures whose fringe
    centre divides out of the angle (spec 14 F5 finding 1; the CZRPE ladders). The TARGET/CONTROL
    roles are caller-assigned per core, so the same image also serves the RPE (3, 1) rung — the
    Ramsey on the physical control with the target prepped |1> (`_cz_cond_progs(ramsey=...)`).

    Each `cz` is the CZ drive plus the virtual-Z local-phase corrections (`zi` on the control frame,
    `iz` on the target frame — 0 until LocalPhases, spec 01 §4.6, calibrates them). The swept knob
    advances the CZ carrier (FREQ, cz.Frequency) or amp (AMP, cz.Amplitude); the four-sequence
    machinery also serves cz.RelativePhase, which binds a DEAD sweep and host-paces the target's cz
    slot phase between reruns (spec 04 §4.3).

    COUPLER_FORM: the COUPLER fires `ngates` back-to-back CZ pulses (error amplification for
    `ngates`>1) and carries the sweep; the qubit roles bind a dead 0 pair.

    DRIVE_FORM (spec 04 §4.1): no coupler role — each qubit core retunes f_GE → f_CZ ONCE before the
    train, fires `ngates` back-to-back cz slots (B0 startTime auto-advance), and retunes back once
    (the target for its close, after a LEAD gap for the GE phasor regen; the prep likewise ends a
    LEAD before the retuned train). The sweep pair binds LOCKSTEP on both cores; the cz train plays
    in a fresh 0 frame (the slot phase carries each line's phase). `sw`=1 (the EF-sandwich shelf
    core, the module comment) folds the shelving EF X in between prep and train and the un-shelving
    one between train and close (`tail` = LEAD + ef on both cores; 0 plain).

    Every X90/Y90 carries its frame bracket (vz0/vzsum); a Y90 is the X90 + `hpi` (π/2). Both qubit
    cores read out on the shared grid (the target's counts are the measurement; the control's are
    ignored)."""
