"""DRAG calibration (spec 14 F3; walkthrough stage 3.4, reference section "DRAG"):

  optimize_fast_drag — qcal's `optimize_FAST_DRAG` (optimization/pulse.py:19-110), a HOST-only
                       coordinate descent over the FAST_DRAG hyperparameters that minimises the
                       pulse spectrum's magnitude AT THE EF TRANSITION. No hardware: the envelope
                       and its FFT are the whole measurement.
  Leakage            — qcal's `Leakage` (calibration/leakage.py:70-207): a fixed n×X90 train read for
                       P(|2>) while ONE Config value is swept, taking the value that minimises it.

The two are the reference's pair: the FFT optimum is a first guess from the pulse's own spectrum,
`Leakage` then measures the leakage the qubit actually accumulates and refines the same knobs (the
virtual-Z phases first, then `N` and `weights/0`).

Both sweep knobs that are COMPILED IN — a virtual-Z pair is a kernel binding, an envelope kwarg
changes the envelope image — so `Leakage` recompiles per point rather than retuning a slot (spec 14
F3: per-point recompile accepted). The train is deep (the reference uses 101 X90s), which is only
trustworthy since the trains were paced (spec 14 F1)."""

    pre-trained 3-level `classifier`, once per value of ONE swept Config path, and take the value that
    MINIMISES the leaked population (`maximize=True` flips it — qcal's diagnostic direction).

    The reference sweeps the X90's virtual-Z phases first, then the FAST_DRAG `N` and `weights/0`;
    all of those are compiled in (a vz pair is a kernel binding, a kwarg changes the envelope image),
    so each point is its own compile + run — no slot retune is possible. `path` is any Config path and
    `values` the list written to it, so the vz pair is swept by passing whole `[p, p]` pairs.

    `n_gates` is the amplification: qcal uses 101 X90s, which only became trustworthy once the trains
    were paced (spec 14 F1). The train is RAW-mode — the hardware `res` bit cannot separate |1> from
    |2>, so the level comes from the host classifier, exactly as the EF cals do.

    `path` may carry a `{q}` field (`"qubit/{q}/x90/vz"`), which is filled per qubit — the swept
