"""Shared calibration infrastructure (spec 06 §1, spec 08 §6 batched cut-over).

Every calibration runs its whole sweep as ONE batched run on the core (riscq.cal.kernels): the kernel
COMPUTES the swept knob on-core from a scalar sweep descriptor (a Q16 or int pair — spec 09; the input
Arrays are gone), walking it on a FIXED-period grid whose idle head is the T1 relax reset (the model
has no auto-reset, spec-M4 B0), so every readout lands at the same time-referenced demod-LO phase. The
demod carrier's discrimination phase (measured by ReadoutCalibration) is baked into the readout tables;
firing the demod IS the readout (its `dur` is the integration window). This module holds the batch
composers:
  - batches / seconds / relax_batches — the physical-units boundary (spec 13 §2: the Config and the
    calibration knobs are Hz / seconds / normalized amp; codes and batches are derived HERE),
  - gate_pulse / prep / x90_vz — the Config's own gate envelopes, qcal's two |1> preps (spec 13 §4)
    and the X90's virtual-Z frame bracket (spec 13 §7),
  - readout_tables / demod_table — the ro-drive + demod-carrier table pair (amp / env / phase / delay),
  - grid_period / batch_timeout — the host-computed fixed period + poll timeout,
  - sweep_q16 — the (x0q, dxq) Q16 sweep descriptor + the exact int x-axis the kernel realizes,
  - population / sweep_counts / rerun_counts — a params-only counts-mode sweep/rerun of ALL requested
    cores in one run, returning {q: |1> population P} (spec 13 §8 simultaneous multi-qubit),
  - acquire_shots — a per-prep raw-mode capture of all cores, returning {q: one prep state's IQ shots}.

# Every PulseGenerator parameter sits behind a depth-4 TimedQueue on the posted RF link, and a push
# into a FULL queue is silently DROPPED (no backpressure reaches the core), so a train may never have
# more than TRAIN_AHEAD gates scheduled ahead of the one now playing. An UNPACED train therefore
# plays its first 4 gates and drops every one after — measured in co-sim, exactly 4 of 96.
#
# Pacing alone is not enough: the core must also SUSTAIN one gate's pushes per train step, or the
# params land after their pulse has begun and the gate plays TRUNCATED. Measured on the real kernels
# at ngates=96 (co-sim gate DAC, tests/test_deep_trains): a step of 30 batches truncates ~56% of the
# gates, 32 is the first clean step, so TRAIN_STEP carries a margin over that.
#
# For a 35 ns X6Y3 X90 (18 batches) the step therefore leaves an IDLE GAP between gates — a
# documented deviation from qcal's back-to-back train. It costs wall time, not physics: the ladder's
# amplified rotation is unchanged, and the extra decoherence is a UNIFORM contrast factor across the
# sweep (every point sits on the same fixed grid), which leaves the parabola vertex — the calibrated
# amplitude — where it was. Pulses at or above TRAIN_STEP (the 70 ns X, the 400 ns CZ) are already
