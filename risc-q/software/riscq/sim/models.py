class TwoLevelModel:
    """qutip-backed driven two-level qubit (spec 05 §3) — the calibration-grade ADC model.

    Drive: reads the core's gate DAC each batch and rotates the qubit by `rabi_rad_per_amp · amp_est`
    (the MAGNITUDE, from amp_est = sqrt(2·mean(sample²)), a phase-blind RMS of the batch's RF drive
    — so a mis-scaled amplitude under/over-rotates, which M4's Amplitude calibration recovers) about
    the xy-plane AXIS recovered by demodulating that same DAC against the qubit frequency `f_ge`
    (see `_drive_axis`). A resonant drive (f_drive == f_ge) has a fixed axis; a detuned carrier — or
    a virtual-Z `set_phase` — ramps the axis, so the Ramsey fringe (two X90s around a wait) and any
    phase error fall straight out of the drive, with NO explicit free-precession term. M3's resonant
    x-rotations are the f_drive == f_ge, axis-≈const case (magnitude unchanged), so it stays exact.

    Readout: emits a CW tone on the core's ADC whose complex amplitude tracks <σz> (soft
    measurement — projective collapse is OMITTED by default; a state-tracking tone + optional
    shot noise is sufficient for every M4 acceptance). Ground (<σz>=+1) and excited (<σz>=−1) tones
    are π out of phase, so the demod's integrated-real SIGN discriminates the state (the `res` bit).

    Projective readout (`collapse=True`, spec 08 §2.4 / B1): needed to validate counts mode, where
    `sign(real)` of a *sampled* shot must be binomial, not a smeared step of ⟨σz⟩. At each readout
    window the model samples s ∈ {0,1} with p₁ = (1−⟨σz⟩)/2, emits the definite-state tone (+amp for
    s=0, −amp for s=1) for the whole window, and collapses the Bloch vector to the sampled pole — so
    repeated reads of a re-prepared superposition give *bimodal* IQ clusters with binomial statistics.
    The window is detected from the READOUT DRIVE (channel 1 → the core's readout DAC): every
    measurement plays it (spec §2.1), and its rising edge is the window opening. Soft mode (default)
    still ignores ch1, so every existing test is unchanged. No qutip solve — the model already tracks
    the Bloch vector, so collapse is a pole assignment.

    Dispersive readout (`chi != 0`, spec 13 Q2): the flat tone above is a caricature — its |0>/|1>
    tones are exactly π out of phase at EVERY frequency, so cluster separation is strictly ∝ |z| and
    the |0>-magnitude peak and the max-separation frequency coincide (which would make Separation's
    acceptance gate vacuous). With `chi` set, the readout is instead a driven RESONATOR whose centre
    shifts by ±chi with the qubit state (`_dispersive`), so the two states' IQ responses differ in
    magnitude AND phase, and max |S21| at |0> (at f_r + chi) is NOT max separation (at f_r). Default
    `chi = 0` ⇒ the flat-tone path, bit-identical to before.

    AC-Stark drive phase (`stark_rad_per_sigma != 0`, spec 13 Q3): the drive above rotates ONLY about
    its xy-axis, so a gate carries no phase error and the X90's virtual-Z pair is correct at 0 — i.e.
    the Phase calibration has nothing to find. With `stark_rad_per_sigma` set, every driven batch also
    rotates the Bloch vector about +z by `stark_rad_per_sigma · amp_est` (a detuning proportional to
    the drive, which is what an ac-Stark shift is), interleaved with the xy rotation. A pulse of drive
    integral σ (= base.gate_sigma, the same Σ amp_est that sets θ = rabi_rad_per_amp·σ) therefore
    accrues ε = stark_rad_per_sigma·σ radians of Z — the phase the calibration's virtual-Z corrects.
    Default 0 ⇒ no z-rotation, bit-identical to before.

    Ground-truth attributes (M4's Amplitude/Frequency/T1/T2 calibrations recover these): `f_ge`,
    `rabi_rad_per_amp`, `t1`, `t2` (t1/t2 in BATCHES). qutip prepares the initial state and defines
    the Pauli operators; the per-batch evolution is the exact analytic Bloch-vector map (a full
    qutip solve per batch would make the co-sim far too slow). Optional gaussian readout noise
    (`noise_scale`, seeded by `noise_seed`) gives realistic IQ scatter for the readout calibrations."""

class TwoQubitModel:
    """Two qutrits + a flux coupler for the CZ calibration (spec two-qubit/01 §6). ONE model holds the
    JOINT 3x3 state psi[a, b] (a = control level, b = target level) — the CZ entangles the pair, so it
    cannot be two independent per-qubit models. It reads three DACs (both gate channels + the coupler
    drive) and drives both qubits' readout tones, frequency-multiplexed onto the shared ADC.

    Every rotation is the SAME demodulate-then-rotate mechanism the one-qubit models use (a resonant
    carrier gives a fixed axis, a detuned one ramps it — the Ramsey/off-resonant-Rabi physics with no
    explicit precession term), lifted to the joint state:

      - single-qubit GE/EF drive: demod that qubit's gate DAC against its f_ge/f_ef, rotate its {0,1}
        or {1,2} subspace for every level of the partner (a product-preserving embedded rotation),
        exactly as ThreeLevelModel does for one qutrit.
      - parametric CZ (`coupler` set — the default): demod the coupler DAC against f_CZ =
        |f_EF(target) - f_GE(control)| (the |11>-|02> detuning, spec 01 §4.2) and rotate the
        {|11>, |02>} PSEUDO-QUBIT by rabi_cz*amp_est about the recovered axis. On resonance (coupler
        carrier == f_CZ) the axis is fixed, so the subspace Rabi-flops |11>->|02>->|11> and a full
        2*pi round trip is -I on {|11>, |02>} — i.e. |11> picks up the conditional pi phase that IS
        the CZ, while |00>/|01>/|10> are untouched. A detuned coupler carrier ramps the axis, which
        is exactly the off-resonant Rabi Ω²/(Ω²+Δ²) (rotating about a ramping equatorial axis at
        ramp-rate Δ == a static (Ω/2)σx-(Δ/2)σz), so the transfer peaks at f_CZ — the resonance the
        CZ Frequency cal finds.
      - two-qubit-drive CZ (`coupler=None`; a `build_model` spec WITHOUT a "coupler" key — the X6Y3
        form, spec 04 §4.6): no coupler exists, the CZ is two simultaneous in-band tones on the
        pair's OWN gate channels at f_CZ = (f_11 + f_02)/4 = (f_ge[0] + 2·f_ge[1] + f_ef[1])/4 (the
        drive-form seed arithmetic, spec 04 §1 — computed from the model's own spectrum, like the
        coupler path's detuning). Each gate DAC gains a THIRD demod, against f_CZ, and the per-batch
        argmax over {GE, EF, CZ} decides which drive that line is (the same comparative mechanism
        that already separates GE from EF); a batch whose carrier is the CZ tone contributes the
        phasor A_i·e^{iφ_i} (A_i = the line's RMS amplitude — detuning-blind, as the coupler path's
        amp_est; φ_i = its f_CZ-demod arg). The EFFECTIVE drive is the COHERENT SUM of the two lines,
        E = A_c·e^{iφ_c} + A_t·e^{iφ_t}, and the {|11>, |02>} pseudo-qubit rotates by rabi_cz·|E|
        about axis arg E — the SAME `_rotate(2, ...)` mechanics as the coupler path, so the detuning
        response (both NCOs retune LOCKSTEP, both demod args ramp together → the Ω²/(Ω²+Δ²) transfer
        peaking at f_CZ) and the conditional-π round trip are identical. What the closed form ADDS is
        the relative-phase dependence: equal lines give |E| = 2A·cos(Δφ/2) — maximal when the two
        absolute-time-referenced tones align (Δφ = 0), extinguished at Δφ = π — the real optimum the
        RelativePhase calibration finds. One line alone still activates at half strength.
      - residual ZZ (`zz_rad_per_batch`): the static ζ|11><11| term, a phase e^{-iζ} on |11> EVERY
        batch. In a target Ramsey it shifts the fringe frequency by ζ only when the control is |1>, so
        JAZZ recovers ζ = f(control=1) - f(control=0) (spec 01 §4.3). Default 0 = the part-1 zero-bias
        point (DC hardware, part 3, wires a nonzero ζ in later).

    Readout: each qubit emits the readout tone at a phase set by its level (`level_phases`, 3 tones
    120° apart -> 3 IQ clusters a ClassifierN tells apart); the two tones ride distinct readout codes
    and SUM on the shared ADC (frequency-multiplexed, each core's demod integrating out its own). Soft
    mode emits the population-weighted phasor of each qubit's MARGINAL; `collapse` mode measures
    PER QUBIT on each readout DAC's rising edge — sample that qubit's level from its marginal,
    PROJECT the joint state onto it, latch for its window (`_update_shot`). Sequential local
    projection reproduces the joint P(00..11) exactly (the second draw is conditioned on the
    first), so on a shared readout DAC both qubits collapse on one edge — the joint sampling —
    while split converters may open their windows at different times without corrupting a partner
    still finishing its own local sequence (spec 01 §5 / spec 19 §7.1).

    Dispersive readout (`chi != 0`, spec 19 §2): instead of the flat tone, each qubit's response is
    a driven RESONATOR at `f_r[i]` of linewidth `kappa`, pulled +chi / -chi / chi2 by its level —
    TwoLevelModel's `_dispersive` mechanism per qubit, built from that qubit's OWN readout drive on
    its own converter pair (the split-converter xcheck-2q map; the collapse trigger watches every
    distinct readout DAC). `f_cz_offset_hz` plants a resonance error off the spectrum arithmetic and
    `cz_phase_offset` a per-line electrical delay on the drive-form phasors — the planted truths the
    CZ cross-check's Frequency and RelativePhase experiments recover.

    Pure-state numpy evolution; optional `t1` amplitude-damps the pair toward |00> on IDLE batches so
    the batched grid's idle head resets each shot (the counterpart of ThreeLevelModel's reset), and
    `fast_forward` applies n of them (plus the every-batch ZZ phase) in closed form. The
    light co-sim gates recover planted f_CZ / ζ / conditional phase; full physics is manual (§6)."""
